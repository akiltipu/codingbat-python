# Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. 
# However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive --
# then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. 
# Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule.
# In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). 
# Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().


# no_teen_sum(1, 2, 3) → 6
# no_teen_sum(2, 13, 1) → 3
# no_teen_sum(2, 1, 14) → 3

def no_teen_sum(a, b, c):
    #return fix_teen(a) + fix_teen(b) + fix_teen(c)
    
    def fix_teen(n):
        if 13 <= n <= 19 and n != 15 and n != 16:
            return 0
    return n
    
    return fix_teen(a) + fix_teen(b) + fix_teen(c)

# def fix_teen(n):
#     if 13 <= n <= 19 and n != 15 and n != 16:
#         return 0
