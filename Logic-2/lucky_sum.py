# Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum.
# However, if one of the values is 13 then it does not count towards the sum and values to its right do not count. 
# So for example, if b is 13, then both b and c do not count.


# lucky_sum(1, 2, 3) → 6
# lucky_sum(1, 2, 13) → 3
# lucky_sum(1, 13, 3) → 1
