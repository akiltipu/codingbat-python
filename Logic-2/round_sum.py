# For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more,
# so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, 
# round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10.
# Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. 
# To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "def round10(num):" and call it 3 times.
# Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as round_sum().


# round_sum(16, 17, 18) â†’ 60
# round_sum(12, 13, 14) â†’ 30
# round_sum(6, 4, 4) â†’ 10


def round_sum(a, b, c):
    return round10(a) + round10(b) + round10(c)
  
def round10(n):
    if n % 10 >= 5:
        return n + (10 - n % 10)
    return n - (n % 10)
