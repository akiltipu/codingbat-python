# Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, 
# which we'll say is the mean average of the values, 
# except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. 
# If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, 
# and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce the final average. 
# You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.


# centered_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3
# centered_average([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5
# centered_average([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) → -3
