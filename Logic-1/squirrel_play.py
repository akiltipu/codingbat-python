# The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. 
# In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive).
#  Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. 
# Given an int temperature and a boolean is_summer, 
# return True if the squirrels play and False otherwise.


# squirrel_play(70, False) → True
# squirrel_play(95, False) → False
# squirrel_play(95, True) → True
