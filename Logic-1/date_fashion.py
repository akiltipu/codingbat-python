# You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. 
# The parameter "you" is the stylishness of your clothes, 
# in the range 0..10, and "date" is the stylishness of your date's clothes. 
# The result getting the table is encoded as an int value with 0=no, 1=maybe, 2=yes. 
# If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). 
# With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, 
# then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).
